# AMBER-Analysis
## Background
From October 2022 to May 2023, under Dr. Hao Yan at the University of North Texas, I have been working on this project

## preliminary results
SCD vs Temperature Graph
![SCD vs Temp Graph](https://github.com/Steve585858/AMBER-Analysis/blob/9da9d46b0f481a5a74cdfc05ded7a3493b39b614/Picture1.png)\
The picture above shows one of the many graphs that we have generated from analysing our results. By maintaining a constant pressure at 300 Bars while altering the temperature from 305K to 315K, we can see that as the temperature gets higher, generally, the SCD (Deuterium Parameter Order) of the lipid will also increase as a consequence.\

![Temperature vs Area Per Lipid](https://github.com/Steve585858/AMBER-Analysis/blob/bf90c85ba6b05d72a01899f65b8a2d311835029f/Temperature%20vs%20Area%20Per%20Lipid.png)\
The picture above highlights the changes temperature makes as it increases on the area per lipid. By changing the pressure and temperature, we can see that as the temperature increases, the area per lipid will increase, whereas when the pressure increases, the area per lipid will decrease.
